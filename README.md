# Sales-Insight-Dashboard
This project focuses on building a sales dashboard to help analyze key sales data and identify performance trends over time. It uses Power BI for visualization and SQL for querying the sales data from a database. The dashboard includes insights such as total sales, sales by region, product performance, and top-selling items.
